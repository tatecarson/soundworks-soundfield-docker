# Soundfield

> *Soundfield* is an example application of the [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks/) framework.

In this example, a *soloist* (for example a participant with a tablet device) controls sound (and light) on a large number of *player* clients distributed in space. At the beginning of the performance, the players indicate their position on a map. The player's positions appear on the soloist's screen so that the soloist can control the sound and light emitted on the player's devices by moving his or her fingers over the touch screen.

```
git clone https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-soundfield.git
cd soundworks-soundfield
npm install
npm run transpile
npm run start
```
